Feel free to do what you want with this pack, just please don't sell it because that's messed up. 
You can use it to make your friends freak (I know I will).
If you have a YouTube channel you can do a Minecraft let's play and some of your viewers will make a racket in your comments sections (if that's your thing)

I just made this for fun, it has no practial purpose. 

Enjoy!

---TO USE THE PACK---

 1. Open Minecraft Java version 1.15 (You will likely get a warning for any other version and it may or may not work correctly.)

 2. Click "Options..."

 3. Click "Resource Packs..."

 4. Press "Open Resource Pack Folder"

 5. Copy or Move Defualt into this folder

 6. Cose the folder and press "Done" (if you were in fullscreen you will need to bring Minecraft back to the top layer by clicking on it from the task bar)

 7. Press "Resource Packs..." again

 8. On the left of the screen under Avalable Resource Packs find Defualt and click on the grass block icon or the text beside it (an arrow pointing to the right will likely appear on top of the icon, this is just to indicate that by clicking on it you are selecting it as a resource pack

 9. Press "Done" (Mojang will likely appear on the screen as if Minecraft was starting up again)

10. Press "Done"

Yay! The Minecraft on top should read MINCERAFT. If it says MINECRAFT something either went wrong or you got extremely lucky. To check just close Minecraft and reopen it in the same version. If it still says MINECRAFT you may be in an incompatable version or something else may be wrong.
